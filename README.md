# **Road Accident Dashboard**
[Link for Dashbord](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sofwan.kaji/viz/RoadAccidentDashboard_17395262919620/Dashboard12)

## Objective:

The purpose of this project is to create a **dashboard** that provides insights into **road accidents** in the UK, including detailed data on accident types, casualties, and the impact of different conditions such as weather and road surface. This dashboard allows users to monitor trends, compare current and previous year data, and filter accident statistics based on different parameters such as severity, vehicle type, and weather conditions.

## Tool:

- **Tableau** for data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Features of the Dashboard:

1. **Key Metrics Overview:**
    - Displays total accidents, total casualties, and fatal casualties for the selected year and compares them with the previous year.
    - Breakdown of accident severity into **Fatal**, **Serious**, and **Slight** casualties.
    - Visuals include bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to show monthly trends and comparative analysis.
2. **Detailed Casualty Insights:**
    - Breakdown of **fatal casualties** by vehicle type, weather condition, and road surface.
    - Interactive filters allow users to adjust the view based on different accident severities, such as **fatal** and **serious** accidents.
    - Data includes vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles) and how each category contributes to overall fatality rates.
3. **Geographical Visualization:**
    - Map displaying locations of fatal accidents across the UK. Each accident location is represented as a point, helping to visually identify hotspots.
    - Data points on the map show accident data, providing further analysis on where most fatalities occur.
4. **Comparative Analysis:**
    - Side-by-side comparison of the **current year** and **previous year** accident data, highlighting trends such as changes in fatalities or the severity of accidents.
    - Key performance indicators (KPIs) for accident reduction goals.
5. **Weather and Road Surface Impact:**
    - Insights into how **weather conditions** (e.g., rain, fog, snow) and **road surface conditions** (e.g., dry, wet) correlate with the number of fatal accidents.
6. **Road Type Breakdown:**
    - Shows the distribution of **fatal casualties** by different road types, such as **single carriageway**, **dual carriageway**, and **roundabouts**.

## Business Impact:

- The dashboard helps **government agencies, insurance companies**, and **road safety organizations** analyze accident data efficiently.
- It allows for targeted interventions, such as increasing awareness in accident-prone areas or during severe weather conditions.
- The dashboard provides **data-driven insights** for improving **road safety policies** and prioritizing infrastructure improvements in high-risk zones.
